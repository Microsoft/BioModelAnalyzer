# Product Roadmap

This document lists some future development paths that could be followed for each of the core components of the BMAChatbot

## NLParser

- Active learning approach to interactively train the parser as to the kind of formulae that the user can submit
- Accept phrases with infix unary operators ie: "a is always 1"
- Enhance the error recovery to perform probabilistic token replacement as well as token skipping
