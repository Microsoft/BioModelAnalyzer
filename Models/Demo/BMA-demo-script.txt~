Intro
=====

Bring together formal_modelling/verification, biology and UI to understand cancer
development.

Applying these ideas in the domain of biology.
Diagrams as standard language in biology to communicate models;

An important property to prove of a biological artifact like Skin or
Leukemia is homeostasis, that the organism reaches stability with some
certain values.

If these verification techniques are to be used, they need to be in a
tool that's usable by a biologist.  MSRC expertise in system
verification and UX/design brought together to solve problem.

Complexity on three fronts; bio model, formal methods and UI; unique
collaboration playing to expertise in all three areas allows us to
develop unique tool built on Azure

Interest from pharma and academia, opening new avenues for analysing
and sharing models


BcrAblNoFeedback
================

Here we have a model showing how the events leading to leukaemia
developing in white blood cells.
BcrAbl (caused by gene fusion/mutation) causes uncontrolled proliferation.
The cells on the right are behavioural markers, telling us the cell fate.

1st run: model stabilizes implies that model is sound. Markers
(Proliferation=2, Self Renewal Capacity=2) show that it's growing
uncontrollably, and control-type behaviours (Growth Arrest=0, Correct
Differentiation=0, Apoptosis=0) are shut down.

We then change the BcrAbl protein (make range [0,0]) to mimic the effect of the "Gleevec" drug.

2nd run: model stabilizes with
(Proliferation=1, Self Renewal Capacity=1, Growth Arrest=0, Correct Differentiation=1, Apoptosis=1)


If we have time ...


Skin1D_unstable
===============

Skin. Made up of 5 layers of cells.
Lowest one on left, topmost is on right.
Develops so that lowest becomes epidermis: divides and pushes one up.
                 topmost eventually sheds.
Each cell is mirrored.
The Wnt and Ligand-in model the environment. In this case, they code up the gradient.


On the formal side, this is a QN.
Each variable ranges over an interval, and has a target function that the variable "wants to become".

This was the initial model, hypothesizing the relationship between the proteins of cell.
But analysis showed that this model didn't reach homeostasis.
Cause: missing relationship b/t GT1-->Jagged.


Skin1D
======

Stability is not just about reaching a fixed point.
The values at the fixed point can be read as a phenotype. This determines fate.


Verification
============

Search for ever increasing regions of stability.
General approach, proving FG(x tighter), until x's interval single point works but doesn't scale.
Faster procedure, based on abstract interpretation over interval domain, scales to very large models.
If stability can't be proven, then fall back to Z3 for completeness.


Result
======

A lot of design iteration on how to show proof and counter-example to biologist.
Currently coloring variables green (stable), pink (cex to stability: bifurcates or cycles).
