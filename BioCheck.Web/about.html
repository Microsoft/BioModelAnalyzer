		Bio Model Analyzer is a new biological modelling tool that illustrates signalling pathways and determines cellular stabilization. The tool represents a merging of perspectives from systems biology, formal methods, human computer interaction and design. At one level, Bio Model Analyzer is a sketching tool that enables users to draw out a biological system of interest (e.g. a genetic regulatory network) by dragging and dropping cells, their contents (DNA, proteins, etc.), extracellular components and relationships onto a simple canvas. At another level, Bio Model Analyzer&#8217;s analysis proves stabilization of biological systems, based upon formal methods that were developed for the specification and verification of properties in concurrent software systems. We hope you enjoy using Bio Model Analyzer and welcome your feedback.

Jasmin Fisher is a Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge and an Associated Lecturer at Cambridge University. Her research focuses on the construction and analysis of executable models that mimic aspects of biological phenomena in order to better understand complex biological systems. She is mainly interested in processes of cell fate determination and signalling networks operating during normal development and cancer.

Byron Cook is a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge and professor of computer science at University College London. His research interests include topics in automatic verification and analysis of systems (e.g. software, hardware, biological models), programming languages, and theorem proving.  Much of Byron's focus in the past 5 years has been on developing automatic tools for proving termination (and other "liveness properties") of software and biological models as well as tools that can reason about mutable data-structures used in programs. Before joining MSR-Cambridge, Byron was a developer in the Windows Base OS group.

				 Socio-Digital Systems - <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/ataylor/" target="_blank">Microsoft Research</a><br>
				<p style="display:none" id="alex">
I joined MSR's Cambridge Lab in September 2004 as a member of the Socio-digital Systems Group (SDS).<br>
Since joining, I've undertaken investigations into a range of routine aspects of everyday life - with a particular emphasis on life at home. For instance, I've shown what some might describe as an unhealthy preoccupation with hoarding, dirt, clutter and similar seemingly banal subject matter. Most recently, I have begun obsessing over robots and other curious &#8216;thinking&#8217; machines.<br>
<br>
Much of this work has been considered alongside the design of computing technology. Rather than informing design directly, however, I've sought with varying success to open up the possibilities for different and hopefully new ways of interacting with technology. A further goal has been to reflect on the intersections between humans and machines, and wonder what the unceasing developments in science and technology might mean for being human.
