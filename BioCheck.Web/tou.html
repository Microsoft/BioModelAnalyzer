			<span class="heading">Microsoft Bio Model Analyzer 1.0 Privacy Statement</span>

<p >Last updated: December 2011</p>

<p >Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy, while
delivering software that brings you the performance, power, and convenience you
desire in your personal computing. This privacy statement explains many of the
data collection and use practices of Microsoft Bio Model Analyzer, 1.0 (&#8220;Bio
Model Analyzer&#8221;).&nbsp; It focuses on features that communicate with the
Internet. It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites,
products, or services. </p>

<p >Bio Model Analyzer is a new biological modelling tool that
illustrates signalling pathways and determines cellular stabilization. At one
level, Bio Model Analyzer is a sketching tool that enables users to draw out a
biological system of interest (e.g. a genetic regulatory network) by dragging
and dropping cells, their contents (genes, proteins, etc.), extracellular
components and relationships onto a simple canvas. At another level, Bio Model
Analyzer&#8217;s analysis proves stabilization of biological systems, based upon
formal methods that were developed for the specification and verification of
properties in concurrent software systems. </p>

<p>Bio Model Analyzer is hosted as an Azure service. The
Silverlight UI is the Web Role, and allows the user to draw, and to save and
load biological models from local storage. The backend Analyzer, the Worker
Role, computes stabilization of the model and returns the result to the UI. </p>

<p>You use the service by either creating a model in the UI or
by loading one from your local computer and, perhaps, editing it. The model is
then sent to the backend Analyzer, which runs a verification function on the
model and returns the result to the UI. You can then store the model back on
your local computer. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Collection and Use of Your Information</span></p>

<p>No login or registration is required to use the Bio Model
Analyzer service, only a knowledge of the URL. The service does not keep a
record of users&#8217; submitted models. The model information is used to run the
Analyzer; this information is discarded once the result is returned. </p>

<p>Although no user/model information is kept, aggregate and
anonymized statistics are collected about the use of the service. Aggregate
statistics may be used to monitor usage volumes, optimization, and for research
purposes only. </p>

<p>The information we collect from you will be used by
Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features
you are using and provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you
have requested or authorized.  It may also be used to analyze and improve
Microsoft products and services.</p>

<p>We may send certain mandatory service communications such as
welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues,
and security announcements. Some Microsoft services may send periodic member
letters that are considered part of the service. We may occasionally request
your feedback, invite you to participate in surveys, or send you promotional
mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft
and its affiliates. Some information we collect may be used at Microsoft
Research for further research in software development, in collaboration with
other academic researchers. Any information used for research purposes at
Microsoft Research will not include any data that personally identifies you.</p>

<p>In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized
experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through
one Microsoft service may be combined with information obtained through other
Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with
information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from
other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on
your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.</p>

<p>Microsoft may access or disclose information about you,
including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the
law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or
property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our
agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good
faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the
personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.  We may also
disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a
merger or sale of assets.</p>

<p>Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by Bio
Model Analyzer may be stored and processed in the United States or any other
country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service
providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as
set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and
Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="bold">Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer</span></p>

<p>When you use software with Internet-enabled features, information
about your computer (&quot;standard computer information&quot;) is sent to the
Web sites you visit and online services you use. Microsoft uses standard
computer information to provide you Internet-enabled services, to help improve
our products and services, and for statistical analysis. Standard computer
information typically includes information such as your IP address, operating
system version, browser version, and regional and language settings. In some
cases, standard computer information may also include hardware ID, which
indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular
feature or service sends information to Microsoft, standard computer
information will be sent as well.&nbsp; </p>

<p><span class="bold">Security of Your Information</span></p>

<p>Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of
your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to
help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For
example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited
access, which are located in controlled facilities. </p>

<p><span class="bold">Changes to this Privacy Statement</span></p>

<p>We will occasionally update this privacy statement to
reflect changes in our products, services, and customer feedback. When we post
changes, we will revise the &quot;last updated&quot; date at the top of this
statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Microsoft
will use your personal information, we will notify you either by posting a
notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending
you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to
be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.</p>

<p><span class="bold">For More Information</span></p>

<p>Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this privacy
statement. If you have questions about this statement or believe that we have
not adhered to it, please contact us at&nbsp; <a
