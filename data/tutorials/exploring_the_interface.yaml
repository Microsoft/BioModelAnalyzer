title: Exploring the Interface
description: |-
  This tutorial will introduce you to the Bio-Model Analyzer and allow you to 
  explore its tools.   
  It takes around 10-15 minutes.
  When you've successfuly completed the tutorial, you will know how to define
  and use model states and temporal properties.
steps:

        To get familiar with the interface, you will be using a pre-built model which 
        represents the habituation of the chemosensing system in bacteria in response 
        to a constant environment. To do this you will need to download and import the 
        ecoli.json file into the BMA tool.

      model: ecoli.json

        To import the model, open the interface and click on the Model tab and then 'Import'
        , once you have chosen your file, the model should appear as shown in this image.

        We will start by defining model states. Open the LTL interface from the right hand 
        side and click the plus sign under 'Linear Temporal Logic'.

        This will open the LTL state editor. Here you need to select the motor variable from  
        the canvas and assign a value of 1, this can be be seen in the image below.
