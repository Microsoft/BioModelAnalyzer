title: Exploring the Interface
description: |-
  This tutorial will introduce you to the Bio-Model Analyzer and allow you to 
  explore its tools.   
  It takes around 10-15 minutes.
  When you've successfuly completed the tutorial, you will know how to define
  and use model states and temporal properties.
steps:

        To get familiar with the interface, you will be using a pre-built model which 
        represents the habituation of the chemosensing system in bacteria in response 
        to a constant environment. To do this you will need to download and import the 
        ecoli.json file into the BMA tool.

        model: ecoli.json

    - text: |- 
        To import the model, open the interface and click on the Model tab and then 'Import'
        , once you have chosen your file, the model should appear as shown in this image.

        We will start by defining model states. Open the LTL interface from the right hand 
        side and click the plus sign under 'Linear Temporal Logic'.

        This will open the LTL state editor. Here you need to select the motor variable from  
        the canvas and assign a value of 1, this can be be seen in the image below.

        Now return to the LTL interface, notice a new state has been defined as 'A', this is
        the one we just created. Now click on the bottom '+' sign to define a new
        temporal property.

        As an example we will be testing to see if the model can reside in the unbiased state 
        (motor=1). We can start by asking for traces where A is always true. To do this, drag
        the always operator into the canvas, and plug the 'A' state into the socket.

        Once you have selected how many steps you require, cick on test to test the query. You
        will now see the operator in green and red stripes. Green stripes indicate the traces 
        that satisfy the query, whereas red is the opposite.

        To explore the traces that satisfy or fail the query, click the 'Open' button. This  
        should open an LTL simulation graph from where you can see if your expression 
        has been matched
