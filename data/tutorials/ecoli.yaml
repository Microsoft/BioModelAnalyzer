        This tutorial is a follow on to the 'Exploring the interface' tutorial and requires
        you to have downloaded and imported the Ecoli model into the BMA tool. If you haven't
        done that already, follow the link below.

        We are interested in showing that the motor in the model always returns to the unbiased 
        state. We can do this with our existing state by dragging a “not” operator to the canvas,
        dragging “A” from the always operator into the “not” operator, and finally by dragging 
        the whole query into the always socket.
